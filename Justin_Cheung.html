<h1>Justin's Page</h1>

<p>    
        Hi, my name is Justin, and I'm a CECS major. 
    More specifically, I want to be a videogame developer. I like the idea of designing games,
    and writing up stories that people can live in. It could be a world that could make them feel
    amazing and powerful, or a world filled with magic and wonder. Regardless, this is something I want
    to grow up to do. However, I also enjoy coding, and I want to explore and develop skills for both options,
    which is why I chose this major. <br>
</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Some of my favorite games are:<h3/>
    <ul>
        <li>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, Explorers of Skies</li>
        <li>Minecraft</li>
        <li>Legend of Zelda Series</li>
        <li>Fire Emblem Series</li>
        <li>Monster Hunter World</li>
        <li>Dungeons and Dragons</li>
    </ul>

    This is a website my brother used to put on my website when I was a kid and left my laptop.<br>
    Now I put up the page on my cousin's laptops.
